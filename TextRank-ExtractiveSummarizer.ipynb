      "But they still want more.They have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it.The band have done \"everything in their considerable powers\" to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world, according to Q magazine editor Paul Rees.We don't want to be thought of as a veteran band.\"\"The challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better - to make records the whole world will listen to,\" Bono recently said.U2, who have won three prestigious Grammy Awards for their hit Vertigo, are stubbornly clinging to their status as one of the biggest bands in the world.The end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band - they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements.They are, perhaps, alone as the only rock band that has got better with age.\"They also have to want it.In 1987, The Joshua Tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including Where the Streets Have No Name, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For and With Or Without You.The stadium-filling, anthemic sound was U2's aim from the start, and their third album, War, saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the Atlantic, going to number one in the UK and 12 in the US.He added: \"They are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up.Their new album, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, comes 28 years after the schoolfriends got together in Dublin and 17 years after The Joshua Tree cemented their place on the all-time rock A-list.These came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music, plus wildly extravagant stage shows, while still trying to retain their mass appeal.Vertigo, the first single from the new album, went straight into the UK singles chart at number one, knocking Eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top 10 hit.Songs like Sunday Bloody Sunday and New Year's Day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band - which Bono rejected as a cliche.Before the release of How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, they had sold 125 million albums around the world. ____\n",
      "_____ They have to be compelling performers, charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground.\"The challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better - to make records the whole world will listen to,\" Bono recently said.Drummer Larry Mullen Jr echoed those sentiments: \"We're very competitive - we want to be on the radio, have big singles.The end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band - they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements.\n"

    "dd = \"\"\"Ajax refuse to rule out Jol move..Ajax have refused to reveal whether Tottenham's boss Martin Jol is on the Dutch champions' shortlist to become the Amsterdam club's new coach...Jol, who has coached in his native Holland, has guided Spurs to the Premiership's top eight. An Ajax spokesman told BBC Sport: \"The coach must fit our profile - a coach who understands the Dutch league and offensive and distinctive football. \"We need to find a solution soon, so someone is in place for next season.\" Ronald Koeman quit as Ajax boss last week after their exit from the Uefa Cup. Jol has been linked with the vacant post at Ajax, with reports saying he has fallen out with Spurs' sporting director Frank Arnesen. But in a statement on Spurs' website, Jol said: \"I'm happy here, I'm not in discussion with anyone else, I don't want to go elsewhere.\" Ajax have enlisted the help of Dutch legend Johann Cruyff, currently a consultant at Barcelona, to help find a new head coach. Cruyff has admitted he has been impressed by the way former RFC Waalwijk coach Jol has turned round Spurs' fortunes since taking over from Jacques Santini. Tonny Bruins Slot and Ruud Krol are currently in charge of Ajax, who are third in the Dutch league.\"\"\""
