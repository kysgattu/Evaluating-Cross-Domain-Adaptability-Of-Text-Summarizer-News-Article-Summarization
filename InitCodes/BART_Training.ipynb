I was nervous about whether I would actually be able to get round. \"I felt good. I just had to relax and use my racing knowledge,\" said Holmes. \"It was all about winning in front of my home crowd. The time is irrelevant. \"I got round in one piece and did not disgrace myself. Now it is about going forward. \"The reception I have had since the Olympics has been amazing and that is why I wanted to keep running this year, because I get a buzz from the crowd.\" Holmes ran a tactically perfect race to finish clear of Frances Hind Dehiba and Russias Svetlana Cherkasova. The Olympic 800m and 1500m champions time was inside the qualifying mark for the European Indoor Championships in Madrid in March. But the 34-year-old would not reveal whether she intended to run or not, having previously indicated she would leave a decision until after the Birmingham Grand Prix on 18 February.\\n   \n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 summarize: Parmar ruled out of Davis Cup tie\\n\\nA knee injury has forced Arvind Parmar out of Great Britains Davis Cup tie in Israel and left Alex Bogdanovic in line to take the second singles place.\\n\\nParmar picked up the injury last week and has failed to recover in time for the Europe/Africa Zone I tie, which begins in Tel Aviv on Friday. Bogdanovic looks set to take the second singles place alongside Greg Rusedski. GB captain Jeremy Bates could use 17-year-old Andrew Murray and David Sherwood in the doubles rubber. Bogdanovic and Murray both pulled out of tournaments last week through injury but are expected to be fit. Jamie Delgado and Lee Childs have been called into the squad in Tel Aviv as designated hitters for team practice but Bates has no plans to call either of them into his squad at present.\\n\\nThe unheralded Sherwood was the surprise inclusion when the squad was announced last week, and Bates said: \"David has earned his place in this squad on the merit of his form and results over the last 12 months.\" The 6ft 4in Sherwood is ranked 264th in the world and the LTA have high hopes for him after Futures tournament wins in Wrexham and Edinburgh.\\n\\nThe Sheffield-born right-hander, aged 24, also reached another final in Plaisir, France, a week after making the semi-final in Mulhouse. Bates is glad to have Rusedski available after Tim Henmans retirement from Davis Cup tennis. \"His wealth of experience is invaluable, particularly to the younger players and I know he will lead by example,\" Bates said. \"We are looking forward to the tie. The squad are all in excellent form.\"\\n   \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  summarize: Elvis set for chart hat-trick\\n\\nThe late US legend Elvis Presley is likely to score his third UK number one single in three weeks on Sunday, according to early sales figures.\\n\\nThe king of rock n roll has already had consecutive chart-toppers with Jailhouse Rock and One Night. A Fool Such As I, the next in a series of 18 reissues, is on course to beat the Chemical Brothers to the top. But his next single, Its Now Or Never, will face a challenge from tsunami charity single Grief Never Grows Old. Sir Cliff Richard, Russell Watson, Boy George, Bill Wyman and members of the Bee Gees, the Beach Boys, America and the Eagles are expected to feature on the charity song.\\n\\nBookmakers have offered odds of 10/1 for all Presleys 18 hits to go back to number one. A Fool Such As I would become the 1,001st number one single in UK chart history after One Night took the 1,000th place on Sunday. The latest release is currently outselling the Chemical Brothers comeback single Galvanize plus other new releases from Athlete, Ciara and Feeder. Presleys 18 original number ones are being reissued as limited release singles, with fans eager to buy the set to fill a collectors box that went on sale in the first week. Record company Sony BMG is now manufacturing 5,000 more copies of each single than originally planned to meet demand, taking the total number of copies of each song on sale to about 28,000.\\n   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                summarize: Wenger dejected as Arsenal slump\\n\\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger claimed their display in the 3-1 defeat against Bayern Munich was \"our worst peformance in the Champions League\".\\n\\nKolo Toures late goal gives the Gunners hope for the second leg, but Wenger said: \"The only positive is that we are still in the tie. \"The players are really down in the dressing-room. I feel we really turned in a bad performance. \"At 3-0 we faced a real struggle, but 3-1 at least gives us a chance.\"\\n\\nGoalscorer Toure was also at fault for two goals, and Wenger said: \"We need to help Toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment.\" Wenger also tried to stay upbeat himself, adding: \"But there is enough time for crying. I could cry - maybe it would be easier - but life goes on. \"In this job, you have good and bad nights. This was a bad night - but I still have confidence in the quality of my players, as well as their spirit and desire.\" But Wengers Bayern counterpart Felix Magath was in no mood to celebrate either. He said: \"I am far from happy despite the win. My players failed to try and score a fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goal.\\n\\n\"Arsenal are fully capable of scoring several goals against us on their own turf.\" Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann, whose personal rivalry with Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn was not helped by the result, said: \"Do I blame myself for the third goal? As a goalkeeper, I always blame myself. \"I just know the goals were very easy against us. In my time here, we have never conceded three easy goals like that - but sometimes it happens. \"It would have been impossible to go through at 3-0 - but with the goal we have chances. Everything is now possible.\"\\n   \n4  summarize: Scotland v Italy (Sat)\\n\\nMurrayfield, Edinburgh\\n\\nSaturday, 26 February\\n\\n1400 GMT\\n\\nBBC1, Five Live and this website\\n\\nVictory for the Azzurri in Rome last year saw Scotland end their campaign without a victory. And the pressure is on Scotland coach Matt Williams as he seeks a first Six Nations victory at the eighth attempt. Italy have lost both their opening games at home to Ireland and Wales, but travel to Edinburgh with high hopes.\\n\\nTheir coach John Kirwan has warned his side they must eradicate the errors that blighted their loss to Wales however or risk suffering a third successive defeat. \"If the defeat against Wales has taught us anything, it is that at this level we cannot make any mistakes,\" Kirwan said. \"In the Six Nations, every error you make will come at a high price. \"We have to be aggressive for 80 minutes, keep calm in every situation and display great maturity on the pitch.\\n\\n\"It will be fundamental to keep cool in the difficult moments - in the key situations of the game.\" Kirwan has recalled the experienced Cristian Stoica at centre and drafted in David dal Maso at open-side after star flanker Mauro Bergamasco was ruled out for the rest of the tournament. Scotland have also made two changes, Simon Webster replacing Simon Danielli on the wing and Simon Taylor returning for his first Test in a year, for injured flanker Jason White. Taylors recovery from a serious knee injury is a major boost to Scottish hopes. \"He is one of the world-class players in the tournament and you want them in your team,\" acknowledged Williams.\\n\\nDespite a record of only two victories from 14 Tests, Williams insists he is revelling in the pressure. \"I actually really enjoy seeing how you cope with such pressure as a coach,\" he said, optimistic despite opening defeats to France and Ireland. \"We were confident for those two first games and we are confident we can beat Italy too,\" he added.\\n\\n: C Paterson; S Webster, A Craig, H Southwell, S Lamont; D Parks, C Cusiter; T Smith, G Bulloch (capt), G Kerr; S Grimes, S Murray; S Taylor, J Petrie, A Hogg.\\n\\nR Russell, B Douglas, N Hines, J Dunbar, M Blair, G Ross, B Hinshelwood.\\n\\nR de Mar   \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Actual Summary  \\\n0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I was nervous about whether I would actually be able to get round.\"It was all about winning in front of my home crowd.Holmes hit the front just before the bell in front of a sell-out crowd in Glasgow and cruised to victory in a time of four minutes 14.74 seconds.\"It was nice to get that out of the way.The Olympic 800m and 1500m champion's time was inside the qualifying mark for the European Indoor Championships in Madrid in March.Britain's Kelly Holmes marked her first appearance on home soil since winning double Olympic gold with 1500m victory at the Norwich Union International.   \n1                                               The unheralded Sherwood was the surprise inclusion when the squad was announced last week, and Bates said: \"David has earned his place in this squad on the merit of his form and results over the last 12 months.\"A knee injury has forced Arvind Parmar out of Great Britain's Davis Cup tie in Israel and left Alex Bogdanovic in line to take the second singles place.Parmar picked up the injury last week and has failed to recover in time for the Europe/Africa Zone I tie, which begins in Tel Aviv on Friday.Bogdanovic and Murray both pulled out of tournaments last week through injury but are expected to be fit.Jamie Delgado and Lee Childs have been called into the squad in Tel Aviv as designated hitters for team practice but Bates has no plans to call either of them into his squad at present.Bogdanovic looks set to take the second singles place alongside Greg Rusedski.   \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  A Fool Such As I would become the 1,001st number one single in UK chart history after One Night took the 1,000th place on Sunday.The late US legend Elvis Presley is likely to score his third UK number one single in three weeks on Sunday, according to early sales figures.Presley's 18 original number ones are being reissued as limited release singles, with fans eager to buy the set to fill a collector's box that went on sale in the first week.Bookmakers have offered odds of 10/1 for all Presley's 18 hits to go back to number one.   \n3                                                                              Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann, whose personal rivalry with Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn was not helped by the result, said: \"Do I blame myself for the third goal?Kolo Toure's late goal gives the Gunners hope for the second leg, but Wenger said: \"The only positive is that we are still in the tie.\"It would have been impossible to go through at 3-0 -
